# Welcome to Nextrip 
This application has been created to show the stops on a particular selection of route and direction.\
This project has been created with Create React App and Tailwindcss.

## Steps to build and run the application:
In the project directory, please execute the following commands:
1. npm install
2. npm start
3. This should launch the application on http://localhost:3000
4. To run the tests, please run `npm run test` from the project directory to launch the test runner in interactive watch mode.

## List of assumptions made during development:
1. The NextTrip apis are always up and running and provide correct response to the fetch requests made from the Client.
2. This application will be used only on the desktop/laptop screens (it is not responsive and has not been catered towards smaller screens - tablets/mobile phones)
3. This application does not respond reasonably to browser back and forward buttons
